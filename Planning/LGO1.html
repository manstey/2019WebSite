<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="line-height:115%; font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:12.0pt; font-weight:normal; ">Hello Latifat</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:12.0pt; font-weight:normal; ">Thank you for your phone call.</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:12.0pt; font-weight:normal; ">As we discussed I am sending you an updated summary with the associated  documents over the next few days.</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:12.0pt; font-weight:normal; ">The summary will try to cover events in chronological order and I will  suggest what I think went wrong (in terms of the Council&rsquo;s administration), how  it could be improved, and finally its implications.</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:12.0pt; font-weight:normal; ">The summary and documents all relate to a development at 12 Davis  Crescent, Pirton (Reference </span></strong><span style="line-height:115%; font-size:12.0pt; ">20/00529/FP)<strong><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-weight:normal; "> and the Planning Department documents are  available on their website.</span></strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">PRE APPLICATION ADVICE - MAY 2019</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">The first document (attached) is the  Pre Application Advice provided by one of the Planners which provides an  indication of some of the potential problems (potential harm) and the local  residents who may be affected.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">What went wrong</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">This document was not placed on the  Council website and was only found after a recent problematical Freedom of  Information investigation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">This document was not mentioned in  subsequent examination of the Planning Application and a number of the problems  and the implicated local residents were not considered or consulted.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">How things could be improved</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">All related Planning Documents should  be placed onto the Council website so local residents are aware of the progress  of an Application and any matters where they could be implicated.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Implicated local residents should be  made aware and should be allowed to be consulted about identified problems</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Implications</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">No one was aware of this document, the  identified problems, and the implicated local residents â€“ the root of many of  the subsequent difficulties.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Subsequently there seems to have been  a determined effort to prevent neighbourhood notification and discussion.</span></p>
