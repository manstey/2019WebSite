<h4>The original planning notice was sent out on 10 March and received sometime later with the  2nd April given as deadline for comments. It was sent to only two local residents (of which I was one).
  I sent a reply on 24th March with the following request</h4>
  
  <p>‘Thank you for your letter dated 10 March Ref 20/00529/FP.
  Please find attached our comments on this application. 
  You will see that we are still in the process of collecting the necessary information for a more fully informed (and we hope useful and constructive) set of comments. This is proving more difficult in the present isolation requirements and we hope that you will consider that it is important, under the circumstances, to allow time for this process to be completed. It would be helpful if you could let us know if this will be possible.’</p>
  
  <h4>I can trace no reply to this email.
  I then sent another email on 26 March as no reply had been received to the email of 24th March and my comments had not been posted on the web site with the following request</h4>
  
  <p>‘I hope you will have received our comments – I have been asked by neighbours for a copy of our comments and wonder when they will be available for viewing (to save me running off copies !)’</p>
  
  <h4>There was no reply to my email but on the 27th March our comments were posted onto the web site in response to our request so that our next door neighbours (Alex and Irene) could see our comments.
  I then sent a further email on the 31st March with the following request.</h4>
  
  <p>‘Further to my email below I was wondering if, under present circumstances, you will be allowing extra time for comments ? 
  (24th March email)’</p>
  
  <h4>I can trace no reply to this email.
  As I received no reply I sent another email on the 2 April with the following messages</h4>
  
  <p>‘I must apologise as I have not been able to assess local feeling about Little Lane in time for your deadline for comments.
  I have, however, revised our comments to correct a number of small mistakes and to make it clear, following discussions,  that our support would be for a single storey development. 
  I would be grateful if you would use our revised comment on your web site to make it clear that we support a single storey development but OBJECT to a new two storey house.’</p>
  <h4>As I did not receive a reply  – nor were my comments entered on the web site I sent another email on the 11th June</h4>
  <p>‘Hello North Herts Planning
  It would be helpful if you could let me know if there has been any progress on this planning application.
  It would also be helpful if you could confirm that you received my revised comment dated 2 April as it does not seem to have been recorded in the documentation on your web site.’</p>
  <h4>I think the comments were eventually posted on the 12th June well after the deadline of 2 April
  The deadline for neighbourhood comments remained as per the original deadline (2 April) with only two local residents (of which I am one) being formally informed.
  Revised plans were prepared at planning officer request (details have been requested of this) and were posted on the onto the web site on 25th June and therefore I sent the following request</h4>
  
  <p>‘Thank you for posting the revised plans onto the web site. Could I assume that this will permit the re-opening of request for comments from local residents ?
  I think that this would be helpful as the lifting of lockdown will mean that it will be possible to discuss this with other residents of the Crescent  for the first time.’

  </p>
  <h4>This was refused </h4>
