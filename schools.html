		<h2 align="center"><strong>Building Vertical Growing Systems</strong> for Educational Purposes</h2>
		<h3 align="center">GutterGrow is a simple  constructional method of building vertical growing systems for demonstration and educational purposes. It consists of joints and tubes which can be built into robust 3D frames which hold gutters and/or many other types of plant container. Irrigation tubing, sensors and actuators, LED lighting, loggers and other plant growing  and monitoring equipment can be attached on or through the tubular frame. GutterGrow's form factor can be adjusted to faciltate control of the growing environment and attachment of plant protection against pests and disease</h3>
