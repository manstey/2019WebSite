     <h1 align="center" ><strong>Is the end of the  Printed Circuit Board (PCB) market in sight ?</strong><br></h1>
  
    <p >According to Wikipedia the world  market for bare PCBs exceeded $60.2 billion in 2014 and in 2018, the Global  Single Sided Printed Circuit Board Market Analysis Report estimated that the  PCB market would reach $79 billion by 2024. At the same time the United Nations estimates that 40 million tons of e-waste are produced  every year and the OECD estimates  between 20-50 million tons a year.
    The traditional method of electronic product  construction is the PCB which in essence is the permanent or semi-permanent attachment  of electronic components or modules to thin metal tracks running over the  surface of one or more layers of board. It is therefore productive to ask if  this form of construction is the root cause of part of the mountain of  electronic waste now causing a major world problem. 
    
    <p >The central problem which links PCB construction to electronic  waste is that the permanent or semi-permanent soldering of components or  sub-assemblies to a PCB makes repair, upgrade, disassembly or reuse difficult  or impossible. Hence products are not repaired or upgraded and components and  sub-assemblies are not disassembled or reused, they are simply chucked on the  ever growing and problematical waste mountain. How  can we mitigate this ?    </p>
    <p >A  further consideration relates to the Mean Time Before Failure (MTBF) and the  Residual Value (RV) of the product or disassembled parts. Individual components  have individual MTBFs however the MTBF of a product often translates into the  MTBF of the shortest life component when the costs involved in skilled test and  repair mean that it is uneconomic to diagnose faults. The RV of a non working  product is negative if it is confined to land fill (there is a cost to land  fill). The RV of any repaired or upgraded product is related to its new MTBF or  mean time before further repair or upgrade. The RV of any recoverable component  or sub-assembly is related to the MTBF, and to the nature and range of  alternative uses for the part. The longer the individual MTBF&rsquo;s and the greater  the value, and range of alternative uses, the greater the RV of the sum of the  RV&rsquo;s of the components or sub-assemblies.&nbsp;  So if we want to minimise the cost of electronic waste and maximise all  residual values &ndash; is there a way forward ?      </p>
    <p >If we look  at the bigger picture and see what has happened to the interconnection of  individual electronic products we can start to see what may be on the horizon. In  the not so distant past &nbsp;individual electronic  products used to be connected by metal wires. CD players used to be  connected by speaker wires to speaker arrays. Computers used to be largely  connected by network wiring systems (e.g. Ethernet). Disk drives used to be  connected to computers by means of multi signal pathway BUS connections.  Recently in all these examples the hard wire is being supplanted by new  technologies centred on high speed serial connections often over wireless or  optical communications. Technology is eroding the need for the all the metal  wires.      </p>
    <p >We need to ask  what are the implications of these existing trends at the macro level for the  micro level of the PCB.&nbsp; Do we need these  repair, upgrade and reuse unfriendly PCBs with lots of components firmly  soldered to old fashioned metal tracks? Perhaps not, and if we look at the  changing nature of modules and components we can start to see that the PCB  market is already endangered. Already at the individual component or module  level, on-chip wireless and optical high speed communications are becoming  available. No longer do these components need to be soldered to large numbers  of metal tracks.
      
      We can  envisage that all that may be necessary is that these new components need to be  supported on some form of modular frame replacing the support function of the  traditional PCB. They can then discover each other and communicate by means of  high speed serial wireless or optical communication. This is not to say that  some limited wired connection on the frame to distribute specific signals and  power may not be necessary &ndash; however the multitude of metal signal paths on  modern PCBs would be redundant.</p>
    <p ><br>
      A review of these problems and trends indicates that the replacement of  the custom designed PCB with a multi-purpose multi-product intelligent  communications framework could substantially cut manufacturing costs and  generate major society and consumer benefits and leads to the following  proposals: </p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>It is possible to design an intelligent two or three dimensional       communications framework which would allow ICs, sub assemblies and modules       to be attached and then to identify each other and to configure themselves       into a functional product. Software would sculpt the product. </li>
    <li>There would be major society and consumer benefits &ndash; it would: </li>
    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>Facilitate the ability to upgrade, repair and re-designate use of        electronic products </li>
      <li>Facilitate to ability to reuse functional electronic blocks into        new products </li>
      <li>Provide an eco friendly route to reduce the mountain of        electronics waste</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Communication between ICs, sub assemblies and modules internally       and externally with other devices could now largely be achieved by means       of high speed electrical, wireless or multi-spectral optical serial       communication. </li>
    <li>If we refocus our attention from specific electronic products onto       an intelligent modular communications framework to replace the traditional       PCB we can consider the opportunity for a new marketable item to be a       multi-purpose multi-product intelligent communications framework.</li>
    <li>Replacement of the custom designed PCB with a multipurpose       communications framework could substantially cut cost and enable       simplified production methods.</li>
    <li>Existing state of art exists. This would be a novel application of       a combination of existing technologies. </li>
  </ol>
