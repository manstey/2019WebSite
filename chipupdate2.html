  <h2>This Chiprack project update indicates that the replacement of the custom designed PCB with a multi-purpose multi-product intelligent communications framework could substantially cut manufacturing costs and generate major society and consumer benefits</h2>
  <h2>A review of the project leads to the  following  proposals:
  </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      It is possible to design an intelligent two or  three dimensional communications framework which would allow ICs, sub  assemblies and modules to be attached and then to identify each other and to  configure themselves into a functional product. Software would sculpt the  product.</li><br>
    <li>Communication between ICs, sub assemblies and  modules internally and externally with other devices could now largely be  achieved by means of high speed electrical, wireless or multi-spectral optical  serial communication.
    </li><br>
    <li>
    If we refocus our attention from specific  electronic products onto an intelligent modular communications framework to  replace the traditional PCB we can consider the opportunity for a new  marketable item to be a multi-purpose multi-product intelligent communications  framework.</li><br>
    <li>Replacement of the custom designed PCB with a multipurpose communications framework could substantially cut cost and enable simplified production methods.</li><br>
    <li>
      There would be major society and consumer  benefits â€“ it would:
    </li>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Facilitate the ability to upgrade, repair and re-designate  use of electronic products
      </li>
      <li>
        Facilitate to ability to reuse functional  electronic blocks into new products
      </li>
      <li>
      Provide an eco friendly route to reduce the  mountain of electronics waste</li><br>
    </ol>
    <li>
      Existing state of art exists. This would be a  novel application of a combination of existing technologies.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="worddoc">Around 30 years ago there was an unusual project involving  Dowty, Inmos, Cambridge University and a range of other players which became  known as 'Chiprack'.&nbsp; It sparked  considerable excitement at the time when it won a number of awards and so it  seemed timely to have another look. In addition a pile of debris from the  project has recently come to light and prompted this return to examine some of  the ideas behind the project in the light of recent developments. </p>
  <p>
  Chiprack was, in essence, a modular two or three dimensional  communications framework for supporting and interconnecting arrays of large  scale circuits or modules.&nbsp; There were a  number of papers published at the time that covered the background and progress  of the project and these are given as references at the end of this update.</p>
  <p>The project demonstrated a route to building products without using traditional PCB construction to interconnect large scale circuits or modules and to the substantial benefits that can accrue.</p>
  <p>
    One of the objectives of the project was to facilitate the  recycling and reuse of electronic sub-assemblies (as functional electronic  units). Chiprack was designed to make the electronics part of products &nbsp;easy to assemble and to disassemble by simply  attaching the &nbsp;sub-assemblies onto &nbsp;the communications framework to create products.  The use of a frame to spatially separate electronic sub assemblies is seen as  essential as a step to enable the reuse, replacement or upgrade of  functional&nbsp; electronic sub assemblies  attached to the frame. </p>
  <p>
    At that time,&nbsp; this  was ultimately seen as commercially undesirable with rapid obsolescence seen as  a route to maximising profit growth. Times change, and with mounds of  electronic waste starting to cause concern it occurred that it may be useful to  revisit this problem with a growing need to address ease of repair, upgrade, disassembly  and eco friendly&nbsp; re-deployment in mind.</p>
  <p>
  The project also demonstrated &nbsp;methods by &nbsp;which functional electronic units from  products could be redeployed into new products with the use of programmable  logic to re-arrange required connection paths and implement any required  interface circuitry (effectively this represented the software reconfiguration  of the hardware units into new products). </p>
  <p>
    This second theme related to the first. In order to make  products&nbsp; easy to assemble and  disassemble the communications framework required a modular mechanical&nbsp; element to hold and interconnect the  sub-assemblies. Chiprack employed rectangular mechanical frames to hold and  interconnect the electronic sub-assemblies. At that time this required a large  number of mechanical contacts to accommodate the large number of signal paths  between bus connected sub-assemblies. Despite extensive successful shock and  vibrational testing the large number of contacts &nbsp;was seen as a major weakness. Again times  change and the extensive use of high speed electronic, wireless or optical serial  links have replaced many of the old parallel bus style communications.  Interrogation of added circuitry via serial links can now facilitate  identification of functional units and then their &nbsp;application or role within a product. &nbsp;Again it occurred it may be timely to revisit  this theme in the light of high speed mechanical, optical and wireless serial communications  and the wide availability and application of field programmable electronics.</p>
  <p>
    One of the Chiprack prototypes that generated most interest  at the time involved a three dimensional array of Transputers (in the heady  days of Inmos the British semiconductor manufacturer !!).&nbsp; The Transputers were coupled into &nbsp;three dimensional arrays using the Chiprack  mechanical structures and they then communicated using the high speed serial Transputer  links, This reduced the problem of parallel bus communications with the use of  the high speed serial links while still retaining the ability to easily repair,  expand or disassemble the modular three dimensional structure. <br>
  At the same time a team at Bristol University also  demonstrated the use of high speed optical links to link Chiprack precision  aligned mounted sub-assemblies. Different frequencies of light generating a  span of communication channels.</p>
  <p>
    The electronics waste stream is becoming increasingly  problematical. As with other waste streams the ability to be able to recycle or  reuse sections of this waste stream is a partial and eco friendly solution.  Three problems bedevil this approach for current electronic products. The first  is that it is difficult or impossible to extract useable blocks of electronics  from products (disassemble products) and the second is that it is also difficult  or impossible to incorporate additional blocks of electronics into products to  update or repair the product. Finally the construction of new products from  usable electronic modules is difficult because of the non standard  communications 'framework' &nbsp;(usually a  PCB) used to connect circuits or modules together.</p>
  <p>Replacement of the custom designed PCB with a standardised communications framework was also identified as a route to reduce manufacturing costs by eliminating the need for expensive pick and place assembly methods necessary to populate the variable geography of the PCB</p>
  <p>
  So if we now reflect back to the Chiprack project it is  possible to consider that it adopted the communications 'framework' as the  central standardised&nbsp; hardware support  and interconnection element with the electronic circuitry physically or  dynamically adapting to communicate over the framework. The Chiprack project  demonstrated that it is possible to design a&nbsp;  modular standardised hardware support and communications framework with  assembly and disassembly in mind and also for construction of flat or three  dimensional structures . </p>
  <p>
  &nbsp;It then becomes  possible to envisage this standardised modular hardware framework carrying  power and facilitating complex high speed serial electrical, wireless or optical  communications.&nbsp; Large scale circuits or  modules can then be attached to the framework where they will be identified and  then configured by software into the desired product configuration. </p>
  <p>
  So what would be new that is not already available. Certainly  not designing electronic modules which physically link together into products &nbsp;- numerous examples exist (e.g. dense pac). &nbsp;Certainly the idea of disparate electronic  blocks configuring and adapting to a standardised communications framework is  not new. We have the internet at a worldwide level! Finally also not new is the  use of high speed serial electrical, wireless or optical communications used to  &nbsp;discover and interconnect functional  electronic blocks. Modern computer systems discover, connect and use a wide  variety of hardware units over high speed serial connections (e.g. over USB)</p>
  <p>
    What may be new and useful , in the light of the Chiprack  project, may be to consider how some of these ideas may be combined and &nbsp;then usefully designed into future products. Products  have traditionally been considered as independent functional electronic units  that connect onto a range of communications networks or frameworks. Perhaps we  could refocus our attention onto the communications framework and consider the opportunity  for the new marketable item to be an intelligent communications framework. Then  functional, add on, replaceable electronic units modules or sub-assemblies)  could be mounted onto the intelligent framework which would then identify the  electronic units and then sculpt the product functionality. </p>
  <p>
  So finally what may be possible given current 'state of art'.  &nbsp;The initial purchase of hardware would  not be functional electronic units but the modular communications hardware  elements, building into an intelligent support and communications 'framework',  which could be two or three dimensional. This supporting modular communications  'framework' could be made of extensible elements or preconfigured. This intelligent  'framework' could then be turned into a first product, or range of products, &nbsp;by the mounting of electronic&nbsp; modules which would identified by &lsquo;framework&rsquo;  software and then configured &nbsp;into the  initial 'product/s'. Interconnections within the 'product' would largely be  implemented and reconfigured by means of programmable electrical, wireless or  optical serial communications.&nbsp; Communications  with the external world could occur via appropriate electrical, wireless or  optical communications used within the product. The 'product' could then be easily  repaired, modified or expanded with further electronic modules deployed onto  the intelligent communications 'framework'.&nbsp;  At end of initial 'product' life the existing functional modules could  be removed from the framework for redeployment and new modules could be added  to the intelligent communications 'framework' which would then recognise the  modules and reconfigure to create a new 'product'.</p>
